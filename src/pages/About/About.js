                Iâ€™m Pranjal Tiwari, a passionate Full Stack Developer
                specializing in the MERN stack, database management, and API
                integrations. With hands-on experience in building scalable web
                applications, I focus on crafting efficient, high-performance
                solutions that enhance business operations. My expertise lies in
                developing SaaS platforms, CRM solutions, and invoice management
                systems, optimizing workflows through automation and real-time
                notifications. I thrive on solving complex problems, writing
                clean and maintainable code, and staying ahead of the latest
                technology trends. I aspire to lead impactful tech projects,
                contribute to open-source communities, and eventually build my
                own SaaS product to help businesses streamline their digital
                processes. Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together!
